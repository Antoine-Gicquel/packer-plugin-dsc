# Packer DSC Provisioner

A [Desired State Configuration](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/library/dn249912.aspx) provisioner for [Packer.io](http://packer.io), the machine image automation tool, allowing you to automate the generation of your Windows machine images in a repeatable, reliable way.

Works nicely when combined with a Vagrant development workflow, possibly leveraging the [Vagrant DSC](https://github.com/mefellows/vagrant-dsc) plugin.
